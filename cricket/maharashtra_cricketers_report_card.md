## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Shreyas Iyer
**Conclusion**: The most established and consistent performer among Maharashtra cricketers across all formats.  
**Recommendation**: Should be a core member of the Indian middle-order across formats. Needs to work with specialized coaches on technique against short-pitched bowling and manage his back issues carefully for longevity.

### Ruturaj Gaikwad
**Conclusion**: Shows immense promise, particularly in ODI cricket with an outstanding average of 56.07.  
**Recommendation**: Should be given a consistent run in white-ball formats. Test debut should be considered given his solid technique and temperament. Working specifically on his T20I game would make him a complete batsman across formats.

### Shardul Thakur
**Conclusion**: Valuable utility player who makes significant contributions in crunch situations.  
**Recommendation**: Best utilized in overseas Test matches and as a middle-overs option in ODIs. Should focus on improving his economy rate in limited-overs formats and maintaining fitness for longer bowling spells.

### Prithvi Shaw
**Conclusion**: Enormous potential that remains largely unfulfilled at the international level.  
**Recommendation**: Needs a comprehensive technical overhaul to address weaknesses against the moving ball. A structured fitness and disciplinary regimen could help him realize his potential. Given his age, a long-term development plan should be implemented rather than short-term fixes.
